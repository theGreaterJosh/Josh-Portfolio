            <h2 class="About">ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>My journey with computers began at the age of seven when i started playing computer games. This early interaction sparked a lifelong passion for technology. By sixth grade, I had already set my sights on becoming a programmer. My dedication to this field was solidified when I won a programming competition during my second year of college. I am a hardworking individual, deeply committed to continuous learning and growth in programming and development. Currently, my goal is to become a proficient Full Stack Web Developer, combining my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies to create seamless and efficient web applications.</p>
